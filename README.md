Repo Merging/Pulling Rules
==================


Before doing any work. Make sure you pull the latest version of master branch.
Create your own branch.
Make your modifications in your own branch.
Make sure dili kaau mag dugay ug edit sa imong branch! Basin mo abot na sa point na lisod na i-merge sa master branch kai grabe na ka biya imong branch.
Before merging to master make sure you pull once again the lasest version of master.
Checkout to master then merge your branch to master.
Make sure to check if the master branch works before you push your code to origin. We'll define testing methods later for everyone to do before pushing to origin. The point is not to break the master line of code.
If you break master, make sure to FIX it before Push.
Push all branches to origin.
